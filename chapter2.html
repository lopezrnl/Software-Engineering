    </section>

    <section id="introduction">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>A software process is a set of related activities that leads to the production of a software product. These activities may involve the development of software from scratch in a standard programming language like Java or C. However, business applications are not necessarily developed in this way. New business software is now often developed by extending and modifying existing systems or by configuring and integrating off-the-shelf software or system components.</p>
      <p>There are many different software processes but all must include four activities that are fundamental to software engineering:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>Software specification</em> — The functionality of the software and constraints on its operation must be defined.</li>
        <li><em>Software design and implementation</em> — The software to meet the specification must be produced.</li>
        <li><em>Software validation</em> — The software must be validated to ensure that it does what the customer wants.</li>
        <li><em>Software evolution</em>— The software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In some form, these activities are part of all software processes. In practice, of
        course, they are complex activities in themselves and include sub-activities such as
        requirements validation, architectural design, unit testing, etc. There are also support
        ing process activities such as documentation and software configuration management.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we describe and discuss processes, we usually talk about the activities in
        these processes such as specifying a data model, designing a user interface, etc., and
        the ordering of these activities. However, as well as activities, process descriptions
        may also include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          Products, which are the outcomes of a process activity. For example, the out
          come of the activity of architectural design may be a model of the software
          architecture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roles, which reflect the responsibilities of the people involved in the process.
          Examples of roles are project manager, configuration manager, programmer, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pre- and post-conditions, which are statements that are true before and after a
          process activity has been enacted or a product produced. For example, before
          architectural design begins, a pre-condition may be that all requirements have
          been approved by the customer; after this activity is finished, a post-condition
          might be that the UML models describing the architecture have been reviewed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Software processes are complex and, like all intellectual and creative processes,
        rely on people making decisions and judgments. There is no ideal process and most
        organizations have developed their own software development processes. Processes
        have evolved to take advantage of the capabilities of the people in an organization
        and the specific characteristics of the systems that are being developed. For some
        systems, such as critical systems, a very structured development process is required.
        For business systems, with rapidly changing requirements, a less formal, flexible
        process is likely to be more effective.
      </p>
      <p>
         Sometimes, software processes are categorized as either plan-driven or agile
        processes. Plan-driven processes are processes where all of the process activities are
        planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan. In agile processes,
        which I discuss in Chapter 3, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the
        process to reflect changing customer requirements. As Boehm and Turner (2003)
        discuss, each approach is suitable for different types of software. Generally, you
        need to find a balance between plan-driven and agile processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there is no ‘ideal’ software process, there is scope for improving the
        software process in many organizations. Processes may include outdated techniques
        or may not take advantage of the best practice in industrial software engineering.
        Indeed, many organizations still do not take advantage of software engineering
        methods in their software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software processes can be improved by process standardization where the diver
        sity in software processes across an organization is reduced. This leads to improved
        communication and a reduction in training time, and makes automated process sup
        port more economical. Standardization is also an important first step in introducing
        new software engineering methods and techniques and good software engineering
        practice. I discuss software process improvement in more detail in Chapter 26.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="models">
      <h2 class="software">2.1 Software Process Models</h2>
      <p>As I explained in Chapter 1, a software process model is a simplified representation
        of a software process. Each process model represents a process from a particular per
        spective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. For example,
        a process activity model shows the activities and their sequence but may not show
        the roles of the people involved in these activities. In this section, I introduce a num
        ber of very general process models (sometimes called ‘process paradigms’) and
        present these from an architectural perspective. That is, we see the framework of the
        process but not the details of specific activities.
      </p> 
      <p>These generic models are not definitive descriptions of software processes. Rather,
        they are abstractions of the process that can be used to explain different approaches to
        software development. You can think of them as process frameworks that may be
        extended and adapted to create more specific software engineering processes.
      </p>     
      <p>
             The process models that I cover here are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><em>The waterfall model </em>This takes the fundamental process activities of specifica
          tion, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate
          process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implemen
          tation, testing, and so on.
        </li>
        <img src="images/waterfall.png" alt="Waterfall Model Diagram" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <li><em>Incremental development </em>This approach interleaves the activities of specifica
            tion, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions
            (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.
        </li>
        <li><em>Reuse-oriented software engineering </em>This approach is based on the existence of
            a significant number of reusable components. The system development process
            focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing
            them from scratch.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>These models are not mutually exclusive and are often used together, especially
        for large systems development. For large systems, it makes sense to combine some
        of the best features of the waterfall and the incremental development models. You
        need to have information about the essential system requirements to design a soft
        ware architecture to support these requirements. You cannot develop this incremen
        tally. Sub-systems within a larger system may be developed using different
        approaches. Parts of the system that are well understood can be specified and devel
        oped using a waterfall-based process. Parts of the system which are difficult to
        specify in advance, such as the user interface, should always be developed using an
        incremental approach.
      </p>

      <article id="waterfall">
        <h3>2.1.1 The Waterfall Model</h3>
        <p> The first published model of the software development process was derived from
            more general system engineering processes (Royce, 1970). This model is illustrated
            in Figure 2.1. Because of the cascade from one phase to another, this model is known
            as the ‘waterfall model’ or software life cycle. The waterfall model is an example of
            a plan-driven process—in principle, you must plan and schedule all of the process
            activities before starting work on them.
        </p>
        <P>The principal stages of the waterfall model directly reflect the fundamental devel
            opment activities:
        </P>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>Requirements analysis and definition </em> The system’s services, constraints, and
                goals are established by consultation with system users. They are then defined
                in detail and serve as a system specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>System and software design </em> The systems design process allocates the require
                ments to either hardware or software systems by establishing an overall system
                architecture. Software design involves identifying and describing the fundamen
                tal software system abstractions and their relationships
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Implementation and unit testing </em> During this stage, the software design is real
                ized as a set of programs or program units. Unit testing involves verifying that
                each unit meets its specification.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Integration and system testing </em> The individual program units or programs
                are integrated and tested as a complete system to ensure that the software
                requirements have been met. After testing, the software system is delivered to
                the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Operation and maintenance </em> Normally (although not necessarily), this is the
                longest life cycle phase. The system is installed and put into practical use.
                Maintenance involves correcting errors which were not discovered in earlier
                stages of the life cycle, improving the implementation of system units and
                enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
           In principle, the result of each phase is one or more documents that are approved
          (‘signed off’). The following phase should not start until the previous phase has fin
          ished. In practice, these stages overlap and feed information to each other. During
          design, problems with requirements are identified. During coding, design problems
          are found and so on. The software process is not a simple linear model but involves
          feedback from one phase to another. Documents produced in each phase may then
          have to be modified to reflect the changes made.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the costs of producing and approving documents, iterations can be
          costly and involve significant rework. Therefore, after a small number of iterations,
          it is normal to freeze parts of the development, such as the specification, and to con
          tinue with the later development stages. Problems are left for later resolution,
          ignored, or programmed around. This premature freezing of requirements may mean
          that the system won’t do what the user wants. It may also lead to badly structured
          systems as design problems are circumvented by implementation tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the final life cycle phase (operation and maintenance) the software is put
          into use. Errors and omissions in the original software requirements are discovered.
          Program and design errors emerge and the need for new functionality is identified.
          The system must therefore evolve to remain useful. Making these changes (software
          maintenance) may involve repeating previous process stages.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Cleanroom software engineering.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>
           The waterfall model is consistent with other engineering process models and docu
          mentation is produced at each phase. This makes the process visible so managers can
          monitor progress against the development plan. Its major problem is the inflexible par
          titioning of the project into distinct stages. Commitments must be made at an early stage
          in the process, which makes it difficult to respond to changing customer requirements.
          In principle, the waterfall model should only be used when the requirements are
          well understood and unlikely to change radically during system development.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the waterfall model reflects the type of process used in other engineering
          projects. As is easier to use a common management model for the whole project,
          software processes based on the waterfall model are still commonly used.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important variant of the waterfall model is formal system development, where
          a mathematical model of a system specification is created. This model is then
          refined, using mathematical transformations that preserve its consistency, into exe
          cutable code. Based on the assumption that your mathematical transformations are
          correct, you can therefore make a strong argument that a program generated in this
          way is consistent with its specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formal development processes, such as that based on the B method (Schneider,
          2001; Wordsworth, 1996) are particularly suited to the development of systems that
          have stringent safety, reliability, or security requirements. The formal approach sim
          plifies the production of a safety or security case. This demonstrates to customers or
          regulators that the system actually meets its safety or security requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Processes based on formal transformations are generally only used in the devel
          opment of safety-critical or security-critical systems. They require specialized
          expertise. For the majority of systems this process does not offer significant cost
          benefits over other approaches to system development.

        <h3>2.1.2 Incremental Development</h3>
        <p> Incremental development is based on the idea of developing an initial implementa
            tion, exposing this to user comment and evolving it through several versions until an
            adequate system has been developed (Figure 2.2). Specification, development, and validation
            activities are interleaved rather than separate, with rapid feedback across
            activities.
        </p>
        <img src="images/Concurrent.png" alt="Incremental Development Diagram" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>
          Incremental software development, which is a fundamental part of agile
          approaches, is better than a waterfall approach for most business, e-commerce, and
          personal systems. Incremental development reflects the way that we solve prob
          lems. We rarely work out a complete problem solution in advance but move toward
          a solution in a series of steps, backtracking when we realize that we have made a
          mistake. By developing the software incrementally, it is cheaper and easier to make
          changes in the software as it is being developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each increment or version of the system incorporates some of the functionality
          that is needed by the customer. Generally, the early increments of the system include
          the most important or most urgently required functionality. This means that the
          customer can evaluate the system at a relatively early stage in the development to see
          if it delivers what is required. If not, then only the current increment has to be
          changed and, possibly, new functionality defined for later increments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Incremental development has three important benefits, compared to the waterfall
          model:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The cost of accommodating changing customer requirements is reduced. The
            amount of analysis and documentation that has to be redone is much less than is
            required with the waterfall model.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is easier to get customer feedback on the development work that has been
            done. Customers can comment on demonstrations of the software and see how
            much has been implemented. Customers find it difficult to judge progress from
            software design documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            More rapid delivery and deployment of useful software to the customer is possi
            ble, even if all of the functionality has not been included. Customers are able to
            use and gain value from the software earlier than is possible with a waterfall
            process.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/Problems with incremental .png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <p>
          Incremental development in some form is now the most common approach for the
          development of application systems. This approach can be either plan-driven, agile,
          or, more usually, a mixture of these approaches. In a plan-driven approach, the system
          increments are identified in advance; if an agile approach is adopted, the early incre
          ments are identified but the development of later increments depends on progress and
          customer priorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a management perspective, the incremental approach has two problems:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure
            progress. If systems are developed quickly, it is not cost-effective to produce
            documents that reflect every version of the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            System structure tends to degrade as new increments are added. Unless time and
            money is spent on refactoring to improve the software, regular change tends to
            corrupt its structure. Incorporating further software changes becomes increas
            ingly difficult and costly.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The problems of incremental development become particularly acute for large,
          complex, long-lifetime systems, where different teams develop different parts of the
          system. Large systems need a stable framework or architecture and the responsibili
          ties of the different teams working on parts of the system need to be clearly defined
          with respect to that architecture. This has to be planned in advance rather than devel
          oped incrementally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process is not visible. Managers need regular deliverables to measure
          You can develop a system incrementally and expose it to customers for comment,
          without actually delivering it and deploying it in the customer’s environment.
          Incremental delivery and deployment means that the software is used in real, opera
          tional processes. This is not always possible as experimenting with new software can
          disrupt normal business processes. I discuss the advantages and disadvantages of incre
          mental delivery in Section 2.3.2

          In the majority of software projects, there is some software reuse. This often happens
          informally when people working on the project know of designs or code that are
          similar to what is required. They look for these, modify them as needed, and incor
          porate them into their system.
        </p>
        <p>
           This informal reuse takes place irrespective of the development process that is
            used. However, in the 21st century, software development processes that focus on the
            reuse of existing software have become widely used. Reuse-oriented approaches rely
            on a large base of reusable software components and an integrating framework for
            the composition of these components. Sometimes, these components are systems in
            their own right (COTS or commercial off-the-shelf systems) that may provide spe
            cific functionality such as word processing or a spreadsheet.
        </p>
        <p> 
            A general process model for reuse-based development is shown in Figure 2.3.
            Although the initial requirements specification stage and the validation stage are
            comparable with other software processes, the intermediate stages in a reuse
            oriented process are different. These stages are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <em>Component analysis</em> Given the requirements specification, a search is made for
              components to implement that specification. Usually, there is no exact match and
              the components that may be used only provide some of the functionality required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Requirements modification</em> During this stage, the requirements are analyzed using
            information about the components that have been discovered. They are then mod
            ified to reflect the available components. Where modifications are impossible, the
            component analysis activity may be re-entered to search for alternative solutions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>System design with reuse </em>During this phase, the framework of the system is
            designed or an existing framework is reused. The designers take into account the
            components that are reused and organize the framework to cater for this. Some
            new software may have to be designed if reusable components are not available.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Development and integration</em> Software that cannot be externally procured is
            developed, and the components and COTS systems are integrated to create the
            new system. System integration, in this model, may be part of the development
            process rather than a separate activity.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          There are three types of software component that may be used in a reuse-oriented
          process:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Web services that are developed according to service standards and which are
            available for remote invocation.
          </li>
          <li>
             Collections of objects that are developed as a package to be integrated with a
             component framework such as .NET or J2EE.
          </li>
          <li>
             Stand-alone software systems that are configured for use in a particular
             environment.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Reuse-oriented software engineering has the obvious advantage of reducing the
          amount of software to be developed and so reducing cost and risks. It usually also
          leads to faster delivery of the software. However, requirements compromises are
          inevitable and this may lead to a system that does not meet the real needs of users.
          Furthermore, some control over the system evolution is lost as new versions of the
          reusable components are not under the control of the organization using them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software reuse is very important and I have dedicated several chapters in the third
          part of the book to this topic. General issues of software reuse and COTS reuse are
          covered in Chapter 16, component-based software engineering in Chapters 17 and
          18, and service-oriented systems in Chapter 19

      <h2 class="activities">2.2 Process activities</h2>
      <p>
        Real software processes are interleaved sequences of technical, collaborative, and
        managerial activities with the overall goal of specifying, designing, implementing,
        and testing a software system. Software developers use a variety of different software
        tools in their work. Tools are particularly useful for supporting the editing of different
        types of document and for managing the immense volume of detailed information
        that is generated in a large software project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The four basic process activities of specification, development, validation, and evo
        lution are organized differently in different development processes. In the waterfall
        model, they are organized in sequence, whereas in incremental development they are
        interleaved. How these activities are carried out depends on the type of software,
        people, and organizational structures involved. In extreme programming, for example,
        specifications are written on cards. Tests are executable and developed before the
        program itself. Evolution may involve substantial system restructuring or refactoring.

      <h3>2.2.1 Software specification</h3>
      <p>
        Software specification or requirements engineering is the process of understanding
        and defining what services are required from the system and identifying the con
        straints on the system’s operation and development. Requirements engineering is a
        particularly critical stage of the software process as errors at this stage inevitably
        lead to later problems in the system design and implementation.
      </p>
        <img src="images/Software development.png"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>
        The requirements engineering process (Figure 2.4) aims to produce an agreed
        requirements document that specifies a system satisfying stakeholder requirements.
        Requirements are usually presented at two levels of detail. End-users and customers
        need a high-level statement of the requirements; system developers need a more
        detailed system specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four main activities in the requirements engineering process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <em>Feasibility study</em> An estimate is made of whether the identified user needs may be
          satisfied using current software and hardware technologies. The study considers
          whether the proposed system will be cost-effective from a business point of view
          and if it can be developed within existing budgetary constraints. A feasibility
          study should be relatively cheap and quick. The result should inform the decision
          of whether or not to go ahead with a more detailed analysis.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Requirements elicitation and analysis</em> This is the process of deriving the system
          requirements through observation of existing systems, discussions with poten
          tial users and procurers, task analysis, and so on. This may involve the develop
          ment of one or more system models and prototypes. These help you understand
          the system to be specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Requirements specification</em> Requirements specification is the activity of trans
          lating the information gathered during the analysis activity into a document that
          defines a set of requirements. Two types of requirements may be included in this
          document. User requirements are abstract statements of the system require
          ments for the customer and end-user of the system; system requirements are a
          more detailed description of the functionality to be provided.
        </li>
        <img src=" images/engineering process.png"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <li>
          <em> Requirements validation</em> This activity checks the requirements for realism, consis
          tency, and completeness. During this process, errors in the requirements document
          are inevitably discovered. It must then be modified to correct these problems.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Of course, the activities in the requirements process are not simply carried out in a
        strict sequence. Requirements analysis continues during definition and specification and
        new requirements come to light throughout the process. Therefore, the activities of
        analysis, definition, and specification are interleaved. In agile methods, such as extreme
        programming, requirements are developed incrementally according to user priorities and
        the elicitation of requirements comes from users who are part of the development team
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="design">
      <h3>Software design and implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The implementation stage of software development is the process of converting a
        system specification into an executable system. It always involves processes of soft
        ware design and programming but, if an incremental approach to development is
        used, may also involve refinement of the software specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        A software design is a description of the structure of the software to be implemented,
        the data models and structures used by the system, the interfaces between system com
        ponents and, sometimes, the algorithms used. Designers do not arrive at a finished
        design immediately but develop the design iteratively. They add formality and detail as
        they develop their design with constant backtracking to correct earlier designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure 2.5 is an abstract model of this process showing the inputs to the design
        process, process activities, and the documents produced as outputs from this process.
        The diagram suggests that the stages of the design process are sequential. In fact,
        design process activities are interleaved. Feedback from one stage to another and
        consequent design rework is inevitable in all design processes.
      </p>
        <img src="images/general model.png"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>Figure 2.5 A general model of the design proces</figcaption>
      <p>
         Most software interfaces with other software systems. These include the operating
        system, database, middleware, and other application systems. These make up the ‘soft
        ware platform’, the environment in which the software will execute. Information about
        this platform is an essential input to the design process, as designers must decide how
        best to integrate it with the software’s environment. The requirements specification is a
        description of the functionality the software must provide and its performance and
        dependability requirements. If the system is to process existing data, then the description
        of that data may be included in the platform specification; otherwise, the data description
        must be an input to the design process so that the system data organization to be defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        The activities in the design process vary, depending on the type of system being
        developed. For example, real-time systems require timing design but may not
        include a database so there is no database design involved. Figure 2.5 shows four
        activities that may be part of the design process for information systems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Architectural design</em>, where you identify the overall structure of the system, the
          principal components (sometimes called sub-systems or modules), their rela
          tionships, and how they are distributed.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Interface design</em>, where you define the interfaces between system components.
          This interface specification must be unambiguous. With a precise interface, a
          component can be used without other components having to know how it is
          implemented. Once interface specifications are agreed, the components can be
          designed and developed concurrently.
        </li>
        <img src=" images/Structured methods.png"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <li>
          <em> Component design</em>, where you take each system component and design how it will
          operate. This may be a simple statement of the expected functionality to be
          implemented, with the specific design left to the programmer. Alternatively, it may
          be a list of changes to be made to a reusable component or a detailed design model.
          The design model may be used to automatically generate an implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Database design</em>, where you design the system data structures and how these are
          to be represented in a database. Again, the work here depends on whether an
          existing database is to be reused or a new database is to be created.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        These activities lead to a set of design outputs, which are also shown in Figure 2.5.
        The detail and representation of these vary considerably. For critical systems, detailed
        design documents setting out precise and accurate descriptions of the system must be
        produced. If a model-driven approach is used, these outputs may mostly be diagrams.
        Where agile methods of development are used, the outputs of the design process may not
        be separate specification documents but may be represented in the code of the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Structured methods for design were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and were
        the precursor to the UML and object-oriented design (Budgen, 2003). They rely on
        producing graphical models of the system and, in many cases, automatically generat
        ing code from these models. Model-driven development (MDD) or model-driven
        engineering (Schmidt, 2006), where models of the software are created at different
        levels of abstraction, is an evolution of structured methods. In MDD, there is greater
        emphasis on architectural models with a separation between abstract implementation
        independent models and implementation-specific models. The models are developed
        in sufficient detail so that the executable system can be generated from them. I discuss
        this approach to development in Chapter 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of a program to implement the system follows naturally from the
        system design processes. Although some classes of program, such as safety-critical
        systems, are usually designed in detail before any implementation begins, it is more
        common for the later stages of design and program development to be interleaved.
        Software development tools may be used to generate a skeleton program from a
        design. This includes code to define and implement interfaces, and, in many cases, the
        developer need only add details of the operation of each program component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming is a personal activity and there is no general process that is usually
        followed. Some programmers start with components that they understand, develop
        these, and then move on to less-understood components. Others take the opposite
        approach, leaving familiar components till last because they know how to develop
        them. Some developers like to define data early in the process then use this to drive
        the program development; others leave data unspecified for as long as possible.
      </p>
      <img src="images/Stages.png"  style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <figcaption> Figure 2.6 Stages of testing</figcaption>
      <p>
        Normally, programmers carry out some testing of the code they have developed. This
        often reveals program defects that must be removed from the program. This is called
        debugging. Defect testing and debugging are different processes. Testing establishes the
        existence of defects. Debugging is concerned with locating and correcting these defects.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you are debugging, you have to generate hypotheses about the observable
        behavior of the program then test these hypotheses in the hope of finding the fault that
        caused the output anomaly. Testing the hypotheses may involve tracing the program
        code manually. It may require new test cases to localize the problem. Interactive
        debugging tools, which show the intermediate values of program variables and a trace
        of the statements executed, may be used to support the debugging process.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="validation">
      <h3> Software validation</h3>
      <p>
         Software validation or, more generally, verification and validation (V&V) is
        intended to show that a system both conforms to its specification and that it meets
        the expectations of the system customer. Program testing, where the system is exe
        cuted using simulated test data, is the principal validation technique. Validation may
        also involve checking processes, such as inspections and reviews, at each stage of the
        software process from user requirements definition to program development.
        Because of the predominance of testing, the majority of validation costs are incurred
        during and after implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for small programs, systems should not be tested as a single, monolithic
        unit. Figure 2.6 shows a three-stage testing process in which system components are
        tested then the integrated system is tested and, finally, the system is tested with the
        customer’s data. Ideally, component defects are discovered early in the process, and
        interface problems are found when the system is integrated. However, as defects are
        discovered, the program must be debugged and this may require other stages in the
        testing process to be repeated. Errors in program components, say, may come to light
        during system testing. The process is therefore an iterative one with information
        being fed back from later stages to earlier parts of the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stages in the testing process are
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <em>Development testing</em> The components making up the system are tested by the
          people developing the system. Each component is tested independently, without
          other system components. Components may be simple entities such as functions
          or object classes, or may be coherent groupings of these entities. Test automa
          tion tools, such as JUnit (Massol and Husted, 2003), that can re-run component
          tests when new versions of the component are created, are commonly used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>System testing</em> System components are integrated to create a complete system.
          This process is concerned with finding errors that result from unanticipated
          interactions between components and component interface problems. It is also
          concerned with showing that the system meets its functional and non-functional
          requirements, and testing the emergent system properties. For large systems,
          this may be a multi-stage process where components are integrated to form sub
          systems that are individually tested before these sub-systems are themselves
          integrated to form the final system.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Acceptance testing</em> This is the final stage in the testing process before the system
          is accepted for operational use. The system is tested with data supplied by the
          system customer rather than with simulated test data. Acceptance testing may
          reveal errors and omissions in the system requirements definition, because the
          real data exercise the system in different ways from the test data. Acceptance
          testing may also reveal requirements problems where the system’s facilities do
          not really meet the user’s needs or the system performance is unacceptable
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Normally, component development and testing processes are interleaved.
        Programmers make up their own test data and incrementally test the code as it is
        developed. This is an economically sensible approach, as the programmer knows the
        component and is therefore the best person to generate test cases.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an incremental approach to development is used, each increment should be
        tested as it is developed, with these tests based on the requirements for that incre
        ment. In extreme programming, tests are developed along with the requirements
        before development starts. This helps the testers and developers to understand the
        requirements and ensures that there are no delays as test cases are created.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a plan-driven software process is used (e.g., for critical systems develop
        ment), testing is driven by a set of test plans. An independent team of testers works
        from these pre-formulated test plans, which have been developed from the system
        specification and design. Figure 2.7 illustrates how test plans are the link between
        testing and development activities. This is sometimes called the V-model of develop
        ment (turn it on its side to see the V).
      </p>
      <p>
        Acceptance testing is sometimes called ‘alpha testing’. Custom systems are
        developed for a single client. The alpha testing process continues until the system
        developer and the client agree that the delivered system is an acceptable implemen
        tation of the requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a system is to be marketed as a software product, a testing process called
        ‘beta testing’ is often used. Beta testing involves delivering a system to a number of
        potential customers who agree to use that system. They report problems to the sys
        tem developers. This exposes the product to real use and detects errors that may not
        have been anticipated by the system builders. After this feedback, the system is mod
        ified and released either for further beta testing or for general sale.
      </p>

    <section id="Software evolution">
      <h3>Software evolution</h3>
      <p>
        The flexibility of software systems is one of the main reasons why more and more
        software is being incorporated in large, complex systems. Once a decision has been
        made to manufacture hardware, it is very expensive to make changes to the hardware
        design. However, changes can be made to software at any time during or after the
        system development. Even extensive changes are still much cheaper than correspon
        ding changes to system hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, there has always been a split between the process of software devel
        opment and the process of software evolution (software maintenance). People think
        of software development as a creative activity in which a software system is devel
        oped from an initial concept through to a working system. However, they sometimes
        think of software maintenance as dull and uninteresting. Although the costs of main
        tenance are often several times the initial development costs, maintenance processes
        are sometimes considered to be less challenging than original software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        This distinction between development and maintenance is increasingly irrelevant.
        Hardly any software systems are completely new systems and it makes much more
        sense to see development and maintenance as a continuum. Rather than two separate
        processes, it is more realistic to think of software engineering as an evolutionary
        process (Figure 2.8) where software is continually changed over its lifetime in
        response to changing requirements and customer needs

        Change is inevitable in all large software projects. The system requirements change
        as the business procuring the system responds to external pressures and management
        priorities change. As new technologies become available, new design and implemen
        tation possibilities emerge. Therefore whatever software process model is used, it is
        essential that it can accommodate changes to the software being developed.
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>
        Change adds to the costs of software development because it usually means that
        work that has been completed has to be redone. This is called rework. For example, if
        the relationships between the requirements in a system have been analyzed and new
        requirements are then identified, some or all of the requirements analysis has to be
        repeated. It may then be necessary to redesign the system to deliver the new require
        ments, change any programs that have been developed, and re-test the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two related approaches that may be used to reduce the costs of rework:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Change avoidance, where the software process includes activities that can antic
          ipate possible changes before significant rework is required. For example, a pro
          totype system may be developed to show some key features of the system to
          customers. They can experiment with the prototype and refine their require
          ments before committing to high software production costs.
        </li> 
        <li>
          Change tolerance, where the process is designed so that changes can be accom
          modated at relatively low cost. This normally involves some form of incremen
          tal development. Proposed changes may be implemented in increments that
          have not yet been developed. If this is impossible, then only a single increment
          (a small part of the system) may have to be altered to incorporate the change.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         In this section, I discuss two ways of coping with change and changing system
         requirements. These are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          System prototyping, where a version of the system or part of the system is developed
          quickly to check the customer’s requirements and the feasibility of some design
          decisions. This supports change avoidance as it allows users to experiment with the
          system before delivery and so refine their requirements. The number of require
          ments change proposals made after delivery is therefore likely to be reduced.
        </li>
        <li>
          Incremental delivery, where system increments are delivered to the customer for
          comment and experimentation. This supports both change avoidance and
          change tolerance. It avoids the premature commitment to requirements for the
          whole system and allows changes to be incorporated into later increments at rel
          atively low cost.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The notion of refactoring, namely improving the structure and organization of a
        program, is also an important mechanism that supports change tolerance. I discuss
        this in Chapter 3, which covers agile methods.

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <figure>

        <figcaption> Figure 2.8 System evolution</figcaption>

      <p>
        A prototype is an initial version of a software system that is used to demonstrate
      concepts, try out design options, and find out more about the problem and its possi
      ble solutions. Rapid, iterative development of the prototype is essential so that costs
      are controlled and system stakeholders can experiment with the prototype early in
      the software process.
      </p>
      <p>
          A software prototype can be used in a software development process to help
        anticipate changes that may be required:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In the requirements engineering process, a prototype can help with the elicita
          tion and validation of system requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the system design process, a prototype can be used to explore particular soft
          ware solutions and to support user interface design.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        System prototypes allow users to see how well the system supports their work.
        They may get new ideas for requirements, and find areas of strength and weakness in
        the software. They may then propose new system requirements. Furthermore, as the
        prototype is developed, it may reveal errors and omissions in the requirements that
        have been proposed. A function described in a specification may seem useful and well
        defined. However, when that function is combined with other functions, users often
        find that their initial view was incorrect or incomplete. The system specification may
        then be modified to reflect their changed understanding of the requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        A system prototype may be used while the system is being designed to carry out
        design experiments to check the feasibility of a proposed design. For example, a
        database design may be prototyped and tested to check that it supports efficient data
        access for the most common user queries. Prototyping is also an essential part of the
        user interface design process. Because of the dynamic nature of user interfaces, tex
        tual descriptions and diagrams are not good enough for expressing the user interface
        requirements. Therefore, rapid prototyping with end-user involvement is the only
        sensible way to develop graphical user interfaces for software systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A process model for prototype development is shown in Figure 2.9. The objec
        tives of prototyping should be made explicit from the start of the process. These may
        be to develop a system to prototype the user interface, to develop a system to validate
        functional system requirements, or to develop a system to demonstrate the feasibility
        of the application to managers. The same prototype cannot meet all objectives. If the
        objectives are left unstated, management or end-users may misunderstand the func
        tion of the prototype. Consequently, they may not get the benefits that they expected
        from the prototype development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next stage in the process is to decide what to put into and, perhaps more
        importantly, what to leave out of the prototype system. To reduce prototyping costs
        and accelerate the delivery schedule, you may leave some functionality out of the
        prototype. You may decide to relax non-functional requirements such as response
        time and memory utilization. Error handling and management may be ignored unless
        the objective of the prototype is to establish a user interface. Standards of reliability
        and program quality may be reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final stage of the process is prototype evaluation. Provision must be made
        during this stage for user training and the prototype objectives should be used to
        derive a plan for evaluation. Users need time to become comfortable with a new sys
        tem and to settle into a normal pattern of usage. Once they are using the system nor
        mally, they then discover requirements errors and omissions.
      </p>
       <p>
        A general problem with prototyping is that the prototype may not necessarily be
        used in the same way as the final system. The tester of the prototype may not be typ
        ical of system users. The training time during prototype evaluation may be insuffi
        cient. If the prototype is slow, the evaluators may adjust their way of working and
        avoid those system features that have slow response times. When provided with bet
        ter response in the final system, they may use it in a different way.
       </p>
       <p>
        Developers are sometimes pressured by managers to deliver throwaway proto
        types, particularly when there are delays in delivering the final version of the soft
        ware. However, this is usually unwise:
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
          It may be impossible to tune the prototype to meet non-functional requirements,
          such as performance, security, robustness, and reliability requirements, which
          were ignored during prototype development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rapid change during development inevitably means that the prototype is undoc
          umented. The only design specification is the prototype code. This is not good
          enough for long-term maintenance.
        </li>
        <li>
          The changes made during prototype development will probably have degraded
          the system structure. The system will be difficult and expensive to maintain.
        </li>
        <li>
          Organizational quality standards are normally relaxed for prototype development.
        </li>
       </ol>
       <p>
         Prototypes do not have to be executable to be useful. Paper-based mock-ups of
        the system user interface (Rettig, 1994) can be effective in helping users refine an
        interface design and work through usage scenarios. These are very cheap to develop
        and can be constructed in a few days. An extension of this technique is a Wizard of
        Oz prototype where only the user interface is developed. Users interact with this
        interface but their requests are passed to a person who interprets them and outputs
        the appropriate response

    <section id="Incremental">
      <h3>Incremental delivery</h3>
      <img src="images/Incremental.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
      <p>
         Incremental delivery (Figure 2.10) is an approach to software development where
      some of the developed increments are delivered to the customer and deployed for use
      in an operational environment. In an incremental delivery process, customers iden
      tify, in outline, the services to be provided by the system. They identify which of the
      services are most important and which are least important to them. A number of
      delivery increments are then defined, with each increment providing a sub-set of the
      system functionality. The allocation of services to increments depends on the service
      priority, with the highest-priority services implemented and delivered first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the system increments have been identified, the requirements for the serv
      ices to be delivered in the first increment are defined in detail and that increment is
      developed. During development, further requirements analysis for later increments
      can take place but requirements changes for the current increment are not accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once an increment is completed and delivered, customers can put it into service.
      This means that they take early delivery of part of the system functionality. They can
      experiment with the system and this helps them clarify their requirements for later sys
      tem increments. As new increments are completed, they are integrated with existing
      increments so that the system functionality improves with each delivered increment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incremental delivery has a number of advantages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Customers can use the early increments as prototypes and gain experience that
        informs their requirements for later system increments. Unlike prototypes, these
        are part of the real system so there is no re-learning when the complete system is
        available.
        </li>
        <li>
           Customers do not have to wait until the entire system is delivered before they
          can gain value from it. The first increment satisfies their most critical require
          ments so they can use the software immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
           The process maintains the benefits of incremental development in that it should
          be relatively easy to incorporate changes into the system.
        </li>
        <li>
          As the highest-priority services are delivered first and increments then inte
        grated, the most important system services receive the most testing. This means
         that customers are less likely to encounter software failures in the most impor
        tant parts of the system
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         However, there are problems with incremental delivery:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Most systems require a set of basic facilities that are used by different parts of the
        system. As requirements are not defined in detail until an increment is to be
        implemented, it can be hard to identify common facilities that are needed by all
        increments.
        </li>
        <li>
          Iterative development can also be difficult when a replacement system is being
        developed. Users want all of the functionality of the old system and are often
        unwilling to experiment with an incomplete new system. Therefore, getting use
        ful customer feedback is difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
          The essence of iterative processes is that the specification is developed in conjunc
        tion with the software. However, this conflicts with the procurement model of
        many organizations, where the complete system specification is part of the system
        development contract. In the incremental approach, there is no complete system
        specification until the final increment is specified. This requires a new form of
        contract, which large customers such as government agencies may find difficult to
        accommodate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are some types of system where incremental development and delivery is
      not the best approach. These are very large systems where development may involve
      teams working in different locations, some embedded systems where the software
      depends on hardware development and some critical systems where all the require
      ments must be analyzed to check for interactions that may compromise the safety or
      security of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        These systems, of course, suffer from the same problems of uncertain and chang
      ing requirements. Therefore, to address these problems and get some of the benefits
      of incremental development, a process may be used in which a system prototype is
      developed iteratively and used as a platform for experiments with the system
      requirements and design. With the experience gained from the prototype, definitive
      requirements can then be agreed.

      <h3> Boehm’s spiral model</h3>
      <p>
         A risk-driven software process framework (the spiral model) was proposed by
        Boehm (1988). This is shown in Figure 2.11. Here, the software process is repre
        sented as a spiral, rather than a sequence of activities with some backtracking from
        one activity to another. Each loop in the spiral represents a phase of the software
        process. Thus, the innermost loop might be concerned with system feasibility, the
        next loop with requirements definition, the next loop with system design, and so on.
        The spiral model combines change avoidance with change tolerance. It assumes that
        changes are a result of project risks and includes explicit risk management activities
        to reduce these risks.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="images/Boehm’s.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>  Figure 2.11 Boehm’s spiral model of the software process (©IEEE 1988)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Each loop in the spiral is split into four sectors:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Objective setting Specific objectives for that phase of the project are defined.
        Constraints on the process and the product are identified and a detailed manage
        ment plan is drawn up. Project risks are identified. Alternative strategies,
        depending on these risks, may be planned.
        </li>
        <li>
          Risk assessment and reduction For each of the identified project risks, a detailed
        analysis is carried out. Steps are taken to reduce the risk. For example, if there is a
        risk that the requirements are inappropriate, a prototype system may be developed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Development and validation After risk evaluation, a development model for the
        system is chosen. For example, throwaway prototyping may be the best devel
        opment approach if user interface risks are dominant. If safety risks are the main
        consideration, development based on formal transformations may be the most
        appropriate process, and so on. If the main identified risk is sub-system integra
        tion, the waterfall model may be the best development model to use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Planning The project is reviewed and a decision made whether to continue with
        a further loop of the spiral. If it is decided to continue, plans are drawn up for the
        next phase of the project.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         The main difference between the spiral model and other software process models is
        its explicit recognition of risk. A cycle of the spiral begins by elaborating objectives
        such as performance and functionality. Alternative ways of achieving these objec
        tives, and dealing with the constraints on each of them, are then enumerated. Each
        alternative is assessed against each objective and sources of project risk are identi
        fied. The next step is to resolve these risks by information-gathering activities such
        as more detailed analysis, prototyping, and simulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once risks have been assessed, some development is carried out, followed by a plan
      ning activity for the next phase of the process. Informally, risk simply means something
      that can go wrong. For example, if the intention is to use a new programming language,
      a risk is that the available compilers are unreliable or do not produce sufficiently effi
      cient object code. Risks lead to proposed software changes and project problems such as
      schedule and cost overrun, so risk minimization is a very important project management
      activity. Risk management, an essential part of project management, is covered in
      Chapter 22

      <h2 class="Rational">The Rational Unified Process (RUP)</h2>
      <p> 
        The Rational Unified Process (RUP) (Krutchen, 2003) is an example of a modern
        process model that has been derived from work on the UML and the associated Unified
        Software Development Process (Rumbaugh, et al., 1999; Arlow and Neustadt, 2005).
        I have included a description here, as it is a good example of a hybrid process model.
        It brings together elements from all of the generic process models (Section 2.1), illus
        trates good practice in specification and design (Section 2.2) and supports prototyping
        and incremental delivery (Section 2.3).
      </p>
      <p>
         The RUP recognizes that conventional process models present a single view of
        the process. In contrast, the RUP is normally described from three perspectives:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li> A dynamic perspective, which shows the phases of the model over time.</li>
        <li> A static perspective, which shows the process activities that are enacted.</li>
        <li> A practice perspective, which suggests good practices to be used during the process</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         Most descriptions of the RUP attempt to combine the static and dynamic perspec
        tives in a single diagram (Krutchen, 2003). I think that makes the process harder to
        understand, so I use separate descriptions of each of these perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The RUP is a phased model that identifies four discrete phases in the software
        process. However, unlike the waterfall model where phases are equated with process
        activities, the phases in the RUP are more closely related to business rather than
        technical concerns. Figure 2.11 shows the phases in the RUP. These are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <i>Inception</i> The goal of the inception phase is to establish a business case for the
          system. You should identify all external entities (people and systems) that will
           interact with the system and define these interactions. You then use this infor
          mation to assess the contribution that the system makes to the business. If this
          contribution is minor, then the project may be cancelled after this phase.
        </li>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/Unified.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
          <figcaption>   Figure 2.12 Phases in the Rational Unified Proces</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <li>
           <i>Elaboration</i> The goals of the elaboration phase are to develop an understanding
          of the problem domain, establish an architectural framework for the system,
          develop the project plan, and identify key project risks. On completion of this
          phase you should have a requirements model for the system, which may be a set
          of UML use-cases, an architectural description, and a development plan for the
          software.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Construction</i> The construction phase involves system design, programming, and
        testing. Parts of the system are developed in parallel and integrated during this
        phase. On completion of this phase, you should have a working software system
        and associated documentation that is ready for delivery to users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Transition</i> The final phase of the RUP is concerned with moving the system
        from the development community to the user community and making it work in
        a real environment. This is something that is ignored in most software process
        models but is, in fact, an expensive and sometimes problematic activity. On
        completion of this phase, you should have a documented software system that is
        working correctly in its operational environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
         Iteration within the RUP is supported in two ways. Each phase may be enacted in
          an iterative way with the results developed incrementally. In addition, the whole set
          of phases may also be enacted incrementally, as shown by the looping arrow from
          Transition to Inception in Figure 2.12.
      </p>
      <p>
        The static view of the RUP focuses on the activities that take place during the
        development process. These are called workflows in the RUP description. There are
        six core process workflows identified in the process and three core supporting work
        flows. The RUP has been designed in conjunction with the UML, so the workflow
        description is oriented around associated UML models such as sequence models,
        object models, etc. The core engineering and support workflows are described in
        Figure 2.13.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage in presenting dynamic and static views is that phases of the devel
        opment process are not associated with specific workflows. In principle at least, all
        of the RUP workflows may be active at all stages of the process. In the early phases
        of the process, most effort will probably be spent on workflows such as business
        modelling and requirements and, in the later phases, in testing and deployment.

       <figcaption>  Figure 2.13 Static workflows in the Rational Unified Process  </figcaption>
      </figure>

        The practice perspective on the RUP describes good software engineering prac
        tices that are recommended for use in systems development. Six fundamental best
        practices are recommended:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Develop software iteratively Plan increments of the system based on customer
          priorities and develop the highest-priority system features early in the develop
          ment process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manage requirements Explicitly document the customer’s requirements and
          keep track of changes to these requirements. Analyze the impact of changes on
          the system before accepting them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use component-based architectures Structure the system architecture into com
          ponents, as discussed earlier in this chapter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Visually model software Use graphical UML models to present static and
         dynamic views of the software.
        </li>
        <li>
           Verify software quality Ensure that the software meets the organizational quality
          standards
        </li>
        <li>
           Control changes to softwareManage changes to the software using a change
          management system and configuration management procedures and tools.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The RUP is not a suitable process for all types of development, e.g., embedded
        software development. However, it does represent an approach that potentially com
        bines the three generic process models discussed in Section 2.1. The most important
        innovations in the RUP are the separation of phases and workflows, and the recogni
        tion that deploying software in a user’s environment is part of the process. Phases are
        dynamic and have goals. Workflows are static and are technical activities that are not
        associated with a single phase but may be used throughout the development to
        achieve the goals of each phase
