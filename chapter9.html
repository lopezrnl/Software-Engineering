            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>Software development does not stop when a system is delivered but continues
                throughout the lifetime of the system. After a system has been deployed, it inevitably
                has to change if it is to remain useful. Business changes and changes to user expectations generate new
                requirements for the existing software. Parts of the software
                may have to be modified to correct errors that are found in operation, to adapt it for
                changes to its hardware and software platform, and to improve its performance or
                other non-functional characteristics.</p>

            <p>Software evolution is important because organizations have invested large
                amounts of money in their software and are now completely dependent on these systems. Their systems are
                critical business assets and they have to invest in system
                change to maintain the value of these assets. Consequently, most large companies
                spend more on maintaining existing systems than on new systems development.
                Based on an informal industry poll, Erlikh (2000) suggests that 85–90% of organizational software costs
                are evolution costs. Other surveys suggest that about two-thirds
                of software costs are evolution costs. For sure, the costs of software change are a
                large part of the IT budget for all companies.</p>

            <p>Software evolution may be triggered by changing business requirements, by
                reports of software defects, or by changes to other systems in a software system’s
                environment. Hopkins and Jenkins (2008) have coined the term ‘brownfield software
                development’ to describe situations in which software systems have to be developed
                and managed in an environment where they are dependent on many other software
                systems.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the evolution of a system can rarely be considered in isolation.
                Changes to the environment lead to system change that may then trigger further
                environmental changes. Of course, the fact that systems have to evolve in a ‘systemsrich’ environment
                often increases the difficulties and costs of evolution. As well as
                understanding and analyzing an impact of a proposed change on the system itself,
                you may also have to assess how this may affect other systems in the operational
                environment.</p>

            <p>Useful software systems often have a very long lifetime. For example, large military or infrastructure
                systems, such as air traffic control systems, may have a lifetime
                of 30 years or more. Business systems are often more than 10 years old. Software
                cost a lot of money so a company has to use a software system for many years to get
                a return on its investment. Obviously, the requirements of the installed systems
                change as the business and its environment change. Therefore, new releases of the
                systems, incorporating changes, and updates, are usually created at regular intervals.
            </p>

            <p>You should, therefore, think of software engineering as a spiral process with
                requirements, design, implementation, and testing going on throughout the lifetime
                of the system (Figure 9.1). You start by creating release 1 of the system. Once delivered, changes are
                proposed and the development of release 2 starts almost immediately. In fact, the need for evolution may
                become obvious even before the system is
                deployed so that later releases of the software may be under development before the
                current version has been released.</p>

                    evolution</p>
                <br>
            </section>

            <p>This model of software evolution implies that a single organization is responsible
                for both the initial software development and the evolution of the software. Most packaged software
                products are developed using this approach. For custom software,
                a different approach is commonly used. A software company develops software for a
                customer and the customer’s own development staff then take over the system. They
                are responsible for software evolution. Alternatively, the software customer might
                issue a separate contract to a different company for system support and evolution.</p>

            <p>In this case, there are likely to be discontinuities in the spiral process. Requirements
                and design documents may not be passed from one company to another. Companies
                may merge or reorganize and inherit software from other companies, and then find
                that this has to be changed. When the transition from development to evolution is not
                seamless, the process of changing the software after delivery is often called ‘software maintenance’. As
                I discuss later in this chapter, maintenance involves extra
                process activities, such as program understanding, in addition to the normal activities of software
                development.</p>

                <br>
            </section>

            <p>Rajlich and Bennett (2000) proposed an alternative view of the software evolution
                life cycle, as shown in Figure 9.2. In this model, they distinguish between evolution
                and servicing. Evolution is the phase in which significant changes to the software
                architecture and functionality may be made. During servicing, the only changes that
                are made are relatively small, essential changes.</p>

            <p>During evolution, the software is used successfully and there is a constant stream
                of proposed requirements changes. However, as the software is modified, its structure tends to degrade
                and changes become more and more expensive. This often happens after a few years of use when other
                environmental changes, such as hardware
                and operating systems, are also often required. At some stage in the life cycle, the
                software reaches a transition point where significant changes, implementing new
                requirements, become less and less cost effective.</p>

            <p>At that stage, the software moves from evolution to servicing. During the servicing phase, the software
                is still useful and used but only small tactical changes are
                made to it. During this stage, the company is usually considering how the software
                can be replaced. In the final stage, phase-out, the software may still be used but no
                further changes are being implemented. Users have to work around any problems
                that they discover.</p>

            <p>Software evolution processes vary depending on the type of software being maintained, the development
                processes used in an organization and the skills of the people involved. In some organizations,
                evolution may be an informal process where
                change requests mostly come from conversations between the system users and
                developers. In other companies, it is a formalized process with structured documentation produced at
                each stage in the process.

            </section>

            <p>System change proposals are the driver for system evolution in all organizations.
                Change proposals may come from existing requirements that have not been implemented in the released
                system, requests for new requirements, bug reports from system
                stakeholders, and new ideas for software improvement from the system development
                team. The processes of change identification and system evolution are cyclic and
                continue throughout the lifetime of a system (Figure 9.3).
            </p>

            <p>Change proposals should be linked to the components of the system that have to
                be modified to implement these proposals. This allows the cost and the impact of the
                change to be assessed. This is part of the general process of change management,
                which also should ensure that the correct versions of components are included in
                each system release. I cover change and configuration management in Chapter 25.

            </section>

            <p>Figure 9.4, adapted from Arthur (1988), shows an overview of the evolution process.
                The process includes the fundamental activities of change analysis, release planning,
                system implementation, and releasing a system to customers. The cost and impact of
                these changes are assessed to see how much of the system is affected by the change and
                how much it might cost to implement the change. If the proposed changes are accepted,
                a new release of the system is planned. During release planning, all proposed changes
                (fault repair, adaptation, and new functionality) are considered. A decision is then made
                on which changes to implement in the next version of the system. The changes are
                implemented and validated, and a new version of the system is released. The process
                then iterates with a new set of changes proposed for the next release.
            </p>


            <p>
                You can think of change implementation as an iteration of the development
                process, where the revisions to the system are designed, implemented, and tested.
                However, a critical difference is that the first stage of change implementation may
                involve program understanding, especially if the original system developers are not
                responsible for change implementation. During this program understanding phase,
                you have to understand how the program is structured, how it delivers functionality,
                and how the proposed change might affect the program. You need this understanding
                to make sure that the implemented change does not cause new problems when it is
                introduced into the existing system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ideally, the change implementation stage of this process should modify the system specification, design,
                and implementation to reflect the changes to the system
                (Figure 9.5). New requirements that reflect the system changes are proposed, analyzed, and validated.
                System components are redesigned and implemented and the
                system is retested. If appropriate, prototyping of the proposed changes may be carried out as part of
                the change analysis process.
            </p>

            <p>
                During the evolution process, the requirements are analyzed in detail and implications of the changes
                emerge that were not apparent in the earlier change analysis
                process. This means that the proposed changes may be modified and further customer discussions may be
                required before they are implemented.

                    Change requests sometimes relate to system problems that have to be tackled
                    urgently. These urgent changes can arise for three reasons:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>If a serious system fault occurs that has to be repaired to allow normal operation to continue.
                    </li>
                    <li>If changes to the system's operating environment have unexpected effects that disrupt normal
                        operation.</li>
                    <li>If there are unanticipated changes to the business running the system, such as the emergence of
                        new competitors or the introduction of new legislation that affects the system.</li>
                </ol>

            </section>

            <p>
                In these cases, the need to make the change quickly means that you may not be
                able to follow the formal change analysis process. Rather than modify the requirements and design, you
                make an emergency fix to the program to solve the immediate problem (Figure 9.6). However, the danger is
                that the requirements, the software
                design, and the code become inconsistent. Although you may intend to document
                the change in the requirements and design, additional emergency fixes to the software may then be
                needed. These take priority over documentation. Eventually, the
                original change is forgotten and the system documentation and code are never
                realigned.
            </p>

            <p>
                Emergency system repairs usually have to be completed as quickly as possible.
                You chose a quick and workable solution rather than the best solution as far as system structure is
                concerned. This accelerates the process of software ageing so that
                future changes become progressively more difficult and maintenance costs increase.
            </p>

            <p>
                Ideally, when emergency code repairs are made the change request should remain
                outstanding after the code faults have been fixed. It can then be reimplemented more
                carefully after further analysis. Of course, the code of the repair may be reused. An
                alternative, better solution to the problem may be discovered when more time is
                available for analysis. In practice, however, it is almost inevitable that these improvements will have
                a low priority. They are often forgotten and, if further system
                changes are made, it then becomes unrealistic to redo the emergency repairs.
            </p>

            <p>
                Agile methods and processes, discussed in Chapter 3, may be used for program
                evolution as well as program development. In fact, because these methods are based
                on incremental development, making the transition from agile development to postdelivery evolution
                should be seamless. Techniques such as automated regression testing
                are useful when system changes are made. Changes may be expressed as user stories
                and customer involvement can prioritize changes that are required in an operational
                system. In short, evolution simply involves continuing the agile development process.

                    However, problems may arise in situations in which there is a handover from a
                    development team to a separate team responsible for evolution. There are two potentially problematic
                    situations:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Where the development team has used an agile approach but the evolution team
                        is unfamiliar with agile methods and prefers a plan-based approach. The evolution team may
                        expect detailed documentation to support evolution and this is
                        rarely produced in agile processes. There may be no definitive statement of the
                        system requirements that can be modified as changes are made to the system.

                    <li>
                        Where a plan-based approach has been used for development but the evolution
                        team prefers to use agile methods. In this case, the evolution team may have to
                        start from scratch developing automated tests and the code in the system may
                        not have been refactored and simplified as is expected in agile development. In
                        this case, some reengineering may be required to improve the code before it can
                        be used in an agile development process.

                Poole and Huisman (2001) report on their experiences in using Extreme Programming
                for maintaining a large system that was originally developed using a plan-based
                approach. After reengineering the system to improve its structure, XP was used very
                successfully in the maintenance process.

            <p>
                Program evolution dynamics is the study of system change. In the 1970s and 1980s,
                Lehman and Belady (1985) carried out several empirical studies of system change
                with a view to understanding more about characteristics of software evolution. The
                work continued in the 1990s as Lehman and others investigated the significance of
                feedback in evolution processes (Lehman, 1996; Lehman et al., 1998; Lehman et al.,
                2001). From these studies, they proposed ‘Lehman’s laws’ concerning system change
                (Figure 9.7).
            </p>

                <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 9.7 </b> | Lehman’s laws</p>
                <br>
            </section>

            <p>
                Lehman and Belady claim these laws are likely to be true for all types of large
                organizational software systems (what they call E-type systems). These are systems
                in which the requirements are changing to reflect changing business needs. New
                releases of the system are essential for the system to provide business value.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first law states that system maintenance is an inevitable process. As the system’s environment
                changes, new requirements emerge and the system must be modified. When the modified system is
                reintroduced to the environment, this promotes
                more environmental changes, so the evolution process starts again.
            </p>

            <p>
                The second law states that, as a system is changed, its structure is degraded. The only
                way to avoid this happening is to invest in preventative maintenance. You spend time
                improving the software structure without adding to its functionality. Obviously, this
                means additional costs, over and above those of implementing required system changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The third law is, perhaps, the most interesting and the most contentious of
                Lehman’s laws. It suggests that large systems have a dynamic of their own that is
                established at an early stage in the development process. This determines the gross
                trends of the system maintenance process and limits the number of possible system
                changes. Lehman and Belady suggest that this law is a consequence of structural factors that influence
                and constrain system change, and organizational factors that
                affect the evolution process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The structural factors that affect the third law come from the complexity of large
                systems. As you change and extend a program, its structure tends to degrade. This is
                true of all types of system (not just software) and it occurs because you are adapting
                a structure intended for one purpose for a different purpose. This degradation, if
                unchecked, makes it more and more difficult to make further changes to the program. Making small changes
                reduces the extent of structural degradation and so
                lessens the risks of causing serious system dependability problems. If you try and
                make large changes, there is a high probability that these will introduce new faults.
                These then inhibit further program changes.
            </p>

            <p>
                The organizational factors that affect the third law reflect the fact that large systems are usually
                produced by large organizations. These companies have internal
                bureaucracies that set the change budget for each system and control the decisionmaking process.
                Companies have to make decisions on the risks and value of the changes and the costs involved. Such
                decisions take time to make and, sometimes, it
                takes longer to decide on the changes to be made than change implementation. The
                speed of the organization’s decision-making processes therefore governs the rate of
                change of the system
            </p>

            <p>
                Lehman’s fourth law suggests that most large programming projects work in a
                ‘saturated’ state. That is, a change to resources or staffing has imperceptible effects
                on the long-term evolution of the system. This is consistent with the third law, which
                suggests that program evolution is largely independent of management decisions.
                This law confirms that large software development teams are often unproductive
                because communication overheads dominate the work of the team.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lehman’s fifth law is concerned with the change increments in each system
                release. Adding new functionality to a system inevitably introduces new system
                faults. The more functionality added in each release, the more faults there will be.
                Therefore, a large increment in functionality in one system release means that this
                will have to be followed by a further release in which the new system faults are
                repaired. Relatively little new functionality should be included in this release. This
                law suggests that you should not budget for large functionality increments in each
                release without taking into account the need for fault repair.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first five laws were in Lehman’s initial proposals; the remaining laws were
                added after further work. The sixth and seventh laws are similar and essentially say
                that users of software will become increasingly unhappy with it unless it is maintained and new
                functionality is added to it. The final law reflects the most recent
                work on feedback processes, although it is not yet clear how this can be applied in
                practical software development.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lehman’s observations seem generally sensible. They should be taken into
                account when planning the maintenance process. It may be that business considerations require them to be
                ignored at any one time. For example, for marketing reasons, it may be necessary to make several major
                system changes in a single release.
                The likely consequences of this are that one or more releases devoted to error repair
                are likely to be required. You often see this in personal computer software when a
                major new release of an application is often quickly followed by a bug repair update.

                9.3 Software maintenance
            </h2>

            <p>
                Software maintenance is the general process of changing a system after it has been
                delivered. The term is usually applied to custom software in which separate development groups are
                involved before and after delivery. The changes made to the software
                may be simple changes to correct coding errors, more extensive changes to correct
                design errors, or significant enhancements to correct specification errors or accommodate new
                requirements. Changes are implemented by modifying existing system
                components and, where necessary, by adding new components to the system.
            </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    There are three different types of software maintenance:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Fault repairs Coding errors are usually relatively cheap to correct; design errors
                        are more expensive as they may involve rewriting several program components.
                        Requirements errors are the most expensive to repair because of the extensive
                        system redesign which may be necessary.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Environmental adaptation This type of maintenance is required when some
                        aspect of the system’s environment such as the hardware, the platform operating
                        system, or other support software changes. The application system must be
                        modified to adapt it to cope with these environmental changes.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Functionality addition This type of maintenance is necessary when the system
                        requirements change in response to organizational or business change. The scale
                        of the changes required to the software is often much greater than for the other
                        types of maintenance.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                In practice, there is not a clear-cut distinction between these types of maintenance. When you adapt the
                system to a new environment, you may add functionality
                to take advantage of new environmental features. Software faults are often exposed
                because users use the system in unanticipated ways. Changing the system to accommodate their way of
                working is the best way to fix these faults.
            </p>

            <p>
                These types of maintenance are generally recognized but different people sometimes give them different
                names. ‘Corrective maintenance’ is universally used to
                refer to maintenance for fault repair. However, ‘adaptive maintenance’ sometimes
                means adapting to a new environment and sometimes means adapting the software to
                new requirements. ‘Perfective maintenance’ sometimes means perfecting the software by implementing new
                requirements; in other cases it means maintaining the
                functionality of the system but improving its structure and its performance. Because
                of this naming uncertainty, I have avoided the use of all of these terms in this chapter.
            </p>

            <p>
                There have been several studies of software maintenance which have looked at
                the relationships between maintenance and development and between different
                maintenance activities (Krogstie et al., 2005; Lientz and Swanson, 1980; Nosek and
                Palvia, 1990; Sousa, 1998). Because of differences in terminology, the details of
                these studies cannot be compared. In spite of changes in technology and different
                application domains, it seems that there has been remarkably little change in the distribution of
                evolution effort since the 1980s.
            </p>

            <p>
                The surveys broadly agree that software maintenance takes up a higher proportion
                of IT budgets than new development (roughly two-thirds maintenance, one-third
                development). They also agree that more of the maintenance budget is spent on
                implementing new requirements than on fixing bugs. Figure 9.8 shows an approximate distribution of
                maintenance costs. The specific percentages will obviously vary
                from one organization to another but, universally, repairing system faults is not the
                most expensive maintenance activity. Evolving the system to cope with new environments and new or
                changed requirements consumes most maintenance effort.

            </section>

            <p>
                The relative costs of maintenance and new development vary from one application domain to another.
                Guimaraes (1983) found that the maintenance costs for business application systems are broadly
                comparable with system development costs.
                For embedded real-time systems, maintenance costs were up to four times more than
                development costs. The high reliability and performance requirements of these systems mean that modules
                have to be tightly linked and hence difficult to change.
                Although these estimates are more than 25 years old, it is unlikely that the cost distributions for
                different types of system have significantly changed.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is usually cost effective to invest effort in designing and implementing a system to
                reduce the costs of future changes. Adding new functionality after delivery is expensive
                because you have to spend time learning the system and analyzing the impact of the proposed changes.
                Therefore, work done during development to make the software easier
                to understand and change is likely to reduce evolution costs. Good software engineering
                techniques, such as precise specification, the use of object-oriented development, and
                configuration management, contribute to maintenance cost reduction.
            </p>

            <p>
                Figure 9.9 shows how overall lifetime costs may decrease as more effort is
                expended during system development to produce a maintainable system. Because of
                the potential reduction in costs of understanding, analysis, and testing, there is a significant
                multiplier effect when the system is developed for maintainability. For
                System 1, extra development costs of $25,000 are invested in making the system
                more maintainable. This results in a savings of $100,000 in maintenance costs over the lifetime of the
                system. This assumes that a percentage increase in development
                costs results in a comparable percentage decrease in overall system costs.

                <p>
                    Legacy systems are old systems that are still useful and are sometimes critical to business
                    operation. They may
                    be implemented using outdated languages and technology or may use other systems that are expensive
                    to
                    maintain. Often their structure has been degraded by change and documentation is missing or out of
                    date.
                    Nevertheless, it may not be cost effective to replace these systems. They may only be used at
                    certain times
                    of the year or it may be too risky to replace them because the specification has been lost.

            <p>
                These estimates are hypothetical but there is no doubt that developing software to
                make it more maintainable is cost effective, when the whole life costs of the software
                are taken into account. This is the rationale for refactoring in agile development.
                Without refactoring, the code becomes more and more difficult and expensive to
                change. However, in plan-based development, the reality is that additional investment in code
                improvement is rarely made during development. This is mostly due to
                the ways most organizations run their budgets. Investing in maintainability leads to
                short-term cost increases, which are measurable. Unfortunately, the long-term gains
                can’t be measured at the same time so companies are reluctant to spend money for an
                unknown future return.

                    It is usually more expensive to add functionality after a system is in operation than
                    it is to implement the same functionality during development. The reasons for this are:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Team stability</em> – After a system has been delivered, it is normal for the development
                        team to be broken up and for people to work on new projects. The new team or the individuals
                        responsible for system maintenance do not understand the system or the background to system
                        design decisions. They need to spend time understanding the existing system before implementing
                        changes to it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Poor development practice</em> – The contract to maintain a system is usually separate from
                        the system development contract. The maintenance contract may be given to a different company
                        rather than the original system developer. This factor, along with the lack of team stability,
                        means that there is no incentive for a development team to write maintainable software. If a
                        development team can cut corners to save effort during development it is worthwhile for them to
                        do so, even if this makes the software more difficult to change in the future.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Staff skills</em> – Maintenance staff are often relatively inexperienced and unfamiliar with
                        the application domain. Maintenance has a poor image among software engineers. It is seen as a
                        less-skilled process than system development and is often allocated to the most junior staff.
                        Furthermore, old systems may be written in obsolete programming languages. The maintenance staff
                        may not have much experience of development in these languages and must learn them to maintain
                        the system.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <em>Program age and structure</em> – As changes are made to programs, their structure
                        tends to degrade. Consequently, as programs age, they become harder to understand and change.
                        Some systems have been developed without modern software
                        engineering techniques. They may never have been well structured and were
                        perhaps optimized for efficiency rather than understandability. System documentation may be lost
                        or inconsistent. Old systems may not have been subject to
                        stringent configuration management so time is often wasted finding the right
                        versions of system components to change.

                </b>

                <p>
                    System documentation can help the maintenance process by providing maintainers with information
                    about the
                    structure and organization of the system and the features that it offers to system users. Although
                    proponents of
                    agile approaches such as XP suggest that the code should be the principal documentation,
                    higher-level design
                    models and information about dependencies and constraints can make it easier to understand and make
                    changes to the code.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have written a separate chapter on documentation that you can download.

            <p>
                The first three of these problems stem from the fact that many organizations still
                consider development and maintenance to be separate activities. Maintenance is seen
                as a second-class activity and there is no incentive to spend money during development
                to reduce the costs of system change. The only long-term solution to this problem is to
                accept that systems rarely have a defined lifetime but continue in use, in some form,
                for an indefinite period. As I suggested in the introduction, you should think of systems as evolving
                throughout their lifetime through a continual development process.
            </p>

            <p>
                The fourth issue, the problem of degraded system structure, is the easiest problem
                to address. Software reengineering techniques (described later in this chapter) may
                be applied to improve the system structure and understandability. Architectural
                transformations can adapt the system to new hardware. Refactoring can improve the
                quality of the system code and make it easier to change.

            <p>
                Managers hate surprises, especially if these result in unexpectedly high costs. You
                should therefore try to predict what system changes might be proposed and what
                parts of the system are likely to be the most difficult to maintain. You should also
                try to estimate the overall maintenance costs for a system in a given time period.
                Figure 9.10 shows these predictions and associated questions.

                    Predicting the number of change requests for a system requires an understanding
                    of the relationship between the system and its external environment. Some systems
                    have a very complex relationship with their external environment and changes to that environment
                    inevitably result in changes to the system. To evaluate the relationships
                    between a system and its environment, you should assess:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>The number and complexity of system interfaces</em> – The larger the number of interfaces
                        and the more complex these interfaces, the more likely it is that interface changes will be
                        required as new requirements are proposed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The number of inherently volatile system requirements</em> – Requirements that reflect
                        organizational policies and procedures are likely to be more volatile than requirements that are
                        based on stable domain characteristics.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The business processes in which the system is used</em> – As business processes evolve, they
                        generate system change requests. The more business processes that use a system, the more the
                        demands for system change.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                For many years, researchers have looked at the relationships between program complexity, as measured by
                metrics such as cyclomatic complexity (McCabe, 1976), and
                maintainability (Banker et al., 1993; Coleman et al., 1994; Kafura and Reddy, 1987;
                Kozlov et al., 2008). It is not surprising that these studies have found that the more
                complex a system or component, the more expensive it is to maintain. Complexity
                measurements are particularly useful in identifying program components that are
                likely to be expensive to maintain. Kafura and Reddy (1987) examined a number of
                system components and found that maintenance effort tended to be focused on a small
                number of complex components. To reduce maintenance costs, therefore, you should
                try to replace complex system components with simpler alternatives.

            <section>
                <p>
                    After a system has been put into service, you may be able to use process data to
                    help predict maintainability. Examples of process metrics that can be used for
                    assessing maintainability are as follows:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Number of requests for corrective maintenance</em> – An increase in the number of bug and
                        failure reports may indicate that more errors are being introduced into the program than are
                        being repaired during the maintenance process. This may indicate a decline in maintainability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Average time required for impact analysis</em> – This reflects the number of program
                        components that are affected by the change request. If this time increases, it implies more and
                        more components are affected and maintainability is decreasing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Average time taken to implement a change request</em> – This is not the same as the time for
                        impact analysis although it may correlate with it. This is the amount of time that you need to
                        modify the system and its documentation, after you have assessed which components are affected.
                        An increase in the time needed to implement a change may indicate a decline in maintainability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Number of outstanding change requests</em> – An increase in this number over time may imply
                        a decline in maintainability.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                You use predicted information about change requests and predictions about system maintainability to
                predict maintenance costs. Most managers combine this information with intuition and experience to
                estimate costs. The COCOMO 2 model of
                cost estimation (Boehm et al., 2000), discussed in Chapter 24, suggests that an estimate for software
                maintenance effort can be based on the effort to understand existing code and the effort to develop the
                new code.

            </h2>

            <p>
                As I discussed in the previous section, the process of system evolution involves
                understanding the program that has to be changed and then implementing these
                changes. However, many systems, especially older legacy systems, are difficult to
                understand and change. The programs may have been optimized for performance or
                space utilization at the expense of understandability, or, over time, the initial program structure may
                have been corrupted by a series of changes.
            </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    To make legacy software systems easier to maintain, you can reengineer these
                    systems to improve their structure and understandability. Reengineering may involve
                    redocumenting the system, refactoring the system architecture, translating programs
                    to a modern programming language, and modifying and updating the structure and
                    values of the system’s data. The functionality of the software is not changed and,
                    normally, you should try to avoid making major changes to the system architecture.
                    There are two important benefits from reengineering rather than replacement:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Reduced risk</em> – There is a high risk in redeveloping business-critical software. Errors
                        may be made in the system specification or there may be development problems. Delays in
                        introducing the new software may mean that business is lost and extra costs are incurred.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Reduced cost</em> – The cost of reengineering may be significantly less than the cost of
                        developing new software. Ulrich (1990) quotes an example of a commercial system for which the
                        reimplementation costs were estimated at $50 million. The system was successfully reengineered
                        for $12 million. With modern software technology, the relative cost of reimplementation is
                        probably less than this but will still considerably exceed the costs of reengineering.

                    Figure 9.11 is a general model of the reengineering process. The input to the
                    process is a legacy program and the output is an improved and restructured version
                    of the same program. The activities in this reengineering process are as follows:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Source code translation</em> – Using a translation tool, the program is converted from an
                        old programming language to a more modern version of the same language or to a different
                        language.

                    <li>
                        <em>Reverse engineering</em> – The program is analyzed and information extracted from it. This
                        helps to document its organization and functionality. Again, this process is usually completely
                        automated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Program structure improvement</em> – The control structure of the program is analyzed and
                        modified to make it easier to read and understand. This can be partially automated but some
                        manual intervention is usually required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Program modularization</em> – Related parts of the program are grouped together and, where
                        appropriate, redundancy is removed. In some cases, this stage may involve architectural
                        refactoring (e.g., a system that uses several different data stores may be refactored to use a
                        single repository). This is a manual process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Data reengineering</em> – The data processed by the program is changed to reflect program
                        changes. This may mean redefining database schemas and converting existing databases to the new
                        structure. You should usually also clean up the data, which involves finding and correcting
                        mistakes, removing duplicate records, etc. Tools are available to support data reengineering.

                Program reengineering may not necessarily require all of the steps in Figure 9.11.
                You don’t need source code translation if you still use the application’s programming
                language. If you can do all reengineering automatically, then recovering documentation through reverse
                engineering may be unnecessary. Data reengineering is only
                required if the data structures in the program change during system reengineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                To make the reengineered system interoperate with the new software, you may
                have to develop adaptor services, as discussed in Chapter 19. These hide the original
                interfaces of the software system and present new, better-structured interfaces that
                can be used by other components. This process of legacy system wrapping is an
                important technique for developing large-scale reusable services.
            </p>

            <p>
                The costs of reengineering obviously depend on the extent of the work that is
                carried out. There is a spectrum of possible approaches to reengineering, as shown
                in Figure 9.12. Costs increase from left to right so that source code translation is
                the cheapest option. Reengineering as part of architectural migration is the most
                expensive.
            </p>

            <p>
                The problem with software reengineering is that there are practical limits to how
                much you can improve a system by reengineering. It isn’t possible, for example, to convert a system
                written using a functional approach to an object-oriented system. Major
                architectural changes or radical reorganizing of the system data management cannot be
                carried out automatically, so they are very expensive. Although reengineering can
                improve maintainability, the reengineered system will probably not be as maintainable
                as a new system developed using modern software engineering methods.

                9.3.3 Preventative maintenance by refactoring
            </h2>

            <p>
                Refactoring is the process of making improvements to a program to slow down degradation through change
                (Opdyke and Johnson, 1990). It means modifying a program to
                improve its structure, to reduce its complexity, or to make it easier to understand.
                Refactoring is sometimes considered to be limited to object-oriented development but
                the principles can be applied to any development approach. When you refactor a program, you should not
                add functionality but should concentrate on program improvement. You can therefore think of refactoring
                as ‘preventative maintenance’ that reduces
                the problems of future change.
            </p>

            <p>
                Although reengineering and refactoring are both intended to make software easier
                to understand and change, they are not the same thing. Reengineering takes place
                after a system has been maintained for some time and maintenance costs are increasing. You use automated
                tools to process and reengineer a legacy system to create a
                new system that is more maintainable. Refactoring is a continuous process of
                improvement throughout the development and evolution process. It is intended to
                avoid the structure and code degradation that increases the costs and difficulties of
                maintaining a system.
            </p>

            <p>
                Refactoring is an inherent part of agile methods such as extreme programming
                because these methods are based around change. Program quality is therefore liable to
                degrade quickly so agile developers frequently refactor their programs to avoid this
                degradation. The emphasis on regression testing in agile methods lowers the risk of
                introducing new errors through refactoring. Any errors that are introduced should be
                detectable as previously successful tests should then fail. However, refactoring is not
                dependent on other ‘agile activities’ and can be used with any approach to development.

                    Fowler et al. (1999) suggest that there are stereotypical situations (he calls them
                    ‘bad smells’) in which the code of a program can be improved. Examples of bad
                    smells that can be improved through refactoring include:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Duplicate code</em> – The same or very similar code may be included at different places in a
                        program. This can be removed and implemented as a single method or function that is called as
                        required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Long methods</em> – If a method is too long, it should be redesigned as a number of shorter
                        methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Switch (case) statements</em> – These often involve duplication, where the switch depends on
                        the type of some value. The switch statements may be scattered around a program. In
                        object-oriented languages, you can often use polymorphism to achieve the same thing.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Data clumping</em> – Data clumps occur when the same group of data items (fields in classes,
                        parameters in methods) reoccur in several places in a program. These can often be replaced with
                        an object encapsulating all of the data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Speculative generality</em> – This occurs when developers include generality in a program in
                        case it is required in future. This can often simply be removed.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                Fowler, in his book and website, also suggests some primitive refactoring transformations that can be
                used singly or together to deal with the bad smells. Examples
                of these transformations include Extract method, where you remove duplication and
                create a new method; Consolidate conditional expression, where you replace a
                sequence of tests with a single test; and Pull up method, where you replace similar
                methods in subclasses with a single method in a super class. Interactive development
                environments, such as Eclipse, include refactoring support in their editors. This
                makes it easier to find dependent parts of a program that have to be changed to
                implement the refactoring.
            </p>

            <p>
                Refactoring, carried out during program development, is an effective way to
                reduce the long-term maintenance costs of a program. However, if you take over a
                program for maintenance whose structure has been significantly degraded, then it
                may be practically impossible to refactor the code alone. You may also have to think
                about design refactoring, which is likely to be a more expensive and difficult problem. Design
                refactoring involves identifying relevant design patterns (discussed in
                Chapter 7) and replacing existing code with code that implements these design patterns (Kerievsky,
                2004). I don’t have space to discuss this here.

                9.4 Legacy system management
            </h2>

            <p>
                For new software systems developed using modern software engineering processes,
                such as incremental development and CBSE, it is possible to plan how to integrate
                system development and evolution. More and more companies are starting to understand that the system
                development process is a whole life-cycle process and that an
                artificial separation between software development and software maintenance is
                unhelpful. However, there are still many legacy systems that are critical business systems. These have
                to be extended and adapted to changing e-business practices.
            </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    Most organizations usually have a portfolio of legacy systems that they use, with
                    a limited budget for maintaining and upgrading these systems. They have to decide
                    how to get the best return on their investment. This involves making a realistic
                    assessment of their legacy systems and then deciding on the most appropriate strategy for evolving
                    these systems. There are four strategic options:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Scrap the system completely</em> – This option should be chosen when the system is not
                        making an effective contribution to business processes. This commonly occurs when business
                        processes have changed since the system was installed and are no longer reliant on the legacy
                        system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Leave the system unchanged and continue with regular maintenance</em> – This option should
                        be chosen when the system is still required but is fairly stable and the system users make
                        relatively few change requests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Reengineer the system to improve its maintainability</em> – This option should be chosen
                        when the system quality has been degraded by change and where a new change to the system is
                        still being proposed. This process may include developing new interface components so that the
                        original system can work with other, newer systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Replace all or part of the system with a new system</em> – This option should be chosen when
                        factors, such as new hardware, mean that the old system cannot continue in operation or where
                        off-the-shelf systems would allow the new system to be developed at a reasonable cost. In many
                        cases, an evolutionary replacement strategy can be adopted in which major system components are
                        replaced by off-the-shelf systems with other components reused wherever possible.

            <p>
                Naturally, these options are not exclusive. When a system is composed of several
                programs, different options may be applied to each program.
            </p>

            <p>
                When you are assessing a legacy system, you have to look at it from a business
                perspective and a technical perspective (Warren, 1998). From a business perspective,
                you have to decide whether or not the business really needs the system. From a technical perspective,
                you have to assess the quality of the application software and the
                system’s support software and hardware. You then use a combination of the business
                value and the system quality to inform your decision on what to do with the legacy
                system.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, assume that an organization has 10 legacy systems. You should
                assess the quality and the business value of each of these systems. You may then create a chart showing
                relative business value and system quality. This is shown in
                Figure 9.13.
            </p>

            <section>
                <p>
                    From Figure 9.13, you can see that there are four clusters of systems:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>Low quality, low business value</em> – Keeping these systems in operation will be expensive
                        and the return to the business will be fairly small. These systems should be scrapped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>Low quality, high business value</em> – These systems are making an important business
                        contribution so they cannot be scrapped. However, their low quality makes them expensive to
                        maintain. They should be reengineered to improve their quality, or replaced if a suitable
                        off-the-shelf system is available.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>High quality, low business value</em> – These systems don’t contribute much to the business
                        but are not very expensive to maintain. Normal maintenance may be continued if costly changes
                        are not required and the system hardware remains in use. If expensive changes become necessary,
                        the software should be scrapped.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>High quality, high business value</em> – These systems must be kept in operation. Their high
                        quality means you don’t need to invest in transformation or replacement, so normal system
                        maintenance should be continued.

                <p>
                    To assess the business value of a system, you have to identify system stakeholders, such as
                    end-users of the system and their managers, and ask a series of questions
                    about the system. There are four basic issues that you have to discuss:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>The use of the system</em> – If systems are only used occasionally or by a small number of
                        people, they may have a low business value. A legacy system may have been developed to meet a
                        business need that has either changed or can now be met more effectively in other ways. However,
                        occasional but essential use (e.g., a university student registration system) can still mean
                        high business value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The business processes that are supported</em> – When a system is introduced, processes are
                        designed to exploit its capabilities. If the system is inflexible, adapting processes may be
                        impossible. As the environment changes, these processes may become obsolete, reducing the
                        system’s business value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The system dependability</em> – Dependability is both a technical and business issue. If a
                        system is unreliable and causes customer problems or diverts staff to fix issues, its business
                        value is low.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The system outputs</em> – The importance of outputs determines value. If the business
                        depends on them, the system has high business value. If outputs can be easily generated
                        elsewhere or are rarely used, its business value is low.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                For example, let’s assume that a company provides a travel ordering system that
                is used by staff responsible for arranging travel. They can place orders with an
                approved travel agent. Tickets are then delivered and the company is invoiced for
                these. However, a business value assessment may reveal that this system is only used
                for a fairly small percentage of travel orders placed. People making travel arrangements find it cheaper
                and more convenient to deal directly with travel suppliers
                through their websites. This system may still be used, but there is no real point in
                keeping it. The same functionality is available from external systems.
            </p>

            <p>
                Conversely, say a company has developed a system that keeps track of all previous customer orders and
                automatically generates reminders for customers to reorder
                goods. This results in a large number of repeat orders and keeps customers satisfied because they feel
                that their supplier is aware of their needs. The outputs from such a
                system are very important to the business and this system therefore has a high
                business value.

            <p>
                To assess a software system from a technical perspective, you need to consider
                both the application system itself and the environment in which the system operates.
                The environment includes the hardware and all associated support software (compilers, development
                environments, etc.) that are required to maintain the system. The
                environment is important because many system changes result from changes to the
                environment, such as upgrades to the hardware or operating system.
            </p>

            <p>
                If possible, in the process of environmental assessment, you should make measurements of the system and
                its maintenance processes. Examples of data that may be
                useful include the costs of maintaining the system hardware and support software,
                the number of hardware faults that occur over some time period and the frequency of
                patches and fixes applied to the system support software.
            </p>

            <p>
                Factors that you should consider during the environment assessment are shown in
                Figure 9.14. Notice that these are not all technical characteristics of the environment.
                You also have to consider the reliability of the suppliers of the hardware and support
                software. If these suppliers are no longer in business, there may not be support for
                their systems.

                    To assess the technical quality of an application system, you have to assess a
                    range of factors (Figure 9.15) that are primarily related to the system dependability,
                    the difficulties of maintaining the system and the system documentation. You may
                    also collect data that will help you judge the quality of the system. Data that may be
                    useful in quality assessment are:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <em>The number of system change requests</em> – System changes usually corrupt the system
                        structure and make further changes more difficult. The higher this accumulated value, the lower
                        the quality of the system.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The number of user interfaces</em> – This is an important factor in forms-based systems
                        where each form can be considered a separate user interface. The more interfaces there are, the
                        more likely inconsistencies and redundancies will appear.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <em>The volume of data used by the system</em> – The higher the volume of data (number of files,
                        size of database, etc.), the greater the likelihood of data inconsistencies that reduce system
                        quality.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <p>
                Ideally, objective assessment should be used to inform decisions about what to do
                with a legacy system. However, in many cases, decisions are not really objective but
                are based on organizational or political considerations. For example, if two businesses
                merge, the most politically powerful partner will usually keep its systems and scrap the other systems.
                If senior management in an organization decide to move to a new
                hardware platform, then this may require applications to be replaced. If there is no
                budget available for system transformation in a particular year, then system maintenance may be
                continued, even though this will result in higher long-term costs.
