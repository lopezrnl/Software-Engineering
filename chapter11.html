                <p class="Introduction-Section-paragraph">As computer systems have become deeply embedded in our business and personal lives, the problems that result from system and software failure are increasing. A failure of server software in an e-commerce company could lead to a major loss of revenue, and possibly also customers for that company. A software error in an embedded control system in a car could lead to expensive recalls of that model for repair and, in the worst case, could be a contributory factor in accidents.</p>
                
                <p class="Introduction-Section-paragraph">Because software-intensive systems are so important to governments, companies, and individuals, it is essential that widely used software is trustworthy. The term 'dependability' was proposed by Laprie (1995) to cover the related systems attributes of availability, reliability, safety, and security. The dependability of systems is now usually more important than their detailed functionality for the following reasons:</p>

If this functionality were left out of the system, only a small number of users would be affected.

                <p class="text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">System availability and reliability are closely related properties that can both be expressed as numerical probabilities. The availability of a system is the probability that the system will be up and running to deliver these services to users on request. The reliability of a system is the probability that the system's services will be delivered as defined in the system specification.</p>

People choose easy-to-guess passwords, write down passwords where they can be found, and system administrators make errors in configuration. We must be careful when classifying problems as user errors - they often reflect poor system design decisions.</p>
